Her Plan Backfires

Hi all — I’ve been browsing here for over a decade... but never worked up the nerve to share until now. I’ve been writing longer-form stories that explore omo as intimacy as much as desperation. Here’s Part 1 of my first thread — hope you enjoy, and I’d love to hear what you think! 🙂!

Her Plan Backfires

Evelyn curled on the sofa, blanket around her legs, eyes bright and restless as Stephen handed her a coffee. He was still dressed casually—slacks, a dark button-up—but his gaze lingered with amused curiosity as she took the cup with both hands.

“You didn’t sleep well,” he observed.

She shook her head, too caffeinated with frustration to lie. “I dreamt… that I didn’t make it to the bathroom. Why does my brain always show me stuff to tempt me??!”

Stephen chuckled. “You know why it’s a bad idea… remember the last time you tried something like that?”

“Yes, Stephen…” She gave him a flat look. “You’ll never let me live down that two hundred dollars’ worth of professional interior car cleaning services from last month… the fact that you keep bringing it up weekly. Multiple times.”

“You know it! See—if you hadn’t been too squirmy to use that smelly public toilet at the pub… $200 could have gone into a real fancy dinner! Just saying~” He winked, all good humor.

“Jerk,” she muttered into her mug.

He leaned in and kissed the top of her head. “Be good today.”

Evelyn’s smile was syrup-sweet. “Aren’t I always?”

Stephen paused at the door, one brow arched, clearly unconvinced. But he said nothing else as he left.

The lock clicked. And Evelyn was alone.

She lingered there for a moment, coffee warming her hands, pulse still humming from that dream. Stephen’s teasing had left her half-irritated, half-aroused, and just reckless enough to want to prove something—to herself if not to him. The thought of having the house to herself all day sent a sly little thrill through her. No one would be the wiser if she indulged a bit. A private game, just for her. As long as she had it under control by the time Stephen came home in the evening, where was the harm?

The moment the door shut, she was already halfway to the kitchen. She’d emptied her bladder the moment she’d woken up—ritualistically. Nothing in the tank, fresh start. Now came the fun part.

She drank a glass of water. Then another. Then she brewed a pot of herbal tea, poured herself a tall mug, and began downing it in slow, measured gulps.

Her body warmed, then filled. She walked slowly around the house, cleaning aimlessly, keeping herself distracted while the liquids moved through her.

Two hours in, and she was at a gentle 4.5. She could feel the weight of it now—not urgent, just… present. She could go if she wanted to. But she didn’t want to. She wanted to build.

By the three-hour mark, her bladder was at a 5.5—a quiet ache, a heaviness that made her shift her weight and uncross her legs on instinct. She felt full enough to be aware of it with every breath, every movement, but not so full that it worried her. She had time.

And then Stephen texted.

Stephen: Just finished with a client near the house. Want to grab a quick lunch? I can swing by in 5.

Evelyn stared at her phone, blinking.

No.

No no no no no.

She bit her lip. Five minutes?

She could’ve used the bathroom.

But if she did, her morning would be wasted. She wouldn’t have time to drink again, to fill again, not if lunch went long. The dream still burned in her nerves, frustration curling hot and insistent, and she wasn’t about to give up the only outlet she had.

So instead, she texted back:

Evelyn: I’ll be ready. ❤️

She threw on a soft beige dress—flowy, with a cinched waist that made her look especially delicate in the torso. It was one of Stephen’s favorites. She pulled her hair into a clip, added sandals, and padded downstairs just as his car pulled into the driveway.

Stephen leaned over and kissed her cheek as she climbed into the passenger seat. “You look lovely.”

“You’re sweet,” she murmured.

He pulled out of the driveway.

“Change of plans,” he said casually. “One of my meetings got pushed to later. We can take our time.”

Her stomach dipped.

“I was thinking the Westwood Bistro.”

Ten more minutes in the car. Then a longer lunch. Then back again.

She smiled anyway. “Sounds perfect.”

###

The wine was exceptional.

She sipped it slowly, grateful for the distraction. Her bladder was now at a 6.2 and climbing, the pressure just at that edge between awareness and discomfort. She crossed her legs beneath the table.

Stephen ordered a four-course set menu. She nearly groaned.

Each course came with paired pours. Each bite of food was rich, exquisite—and excruciating in how slowly time passed.

By the third course, Evelyn was at a 6.8. She couldn’t stop shifting. Her belly felt swollen with more than just food. She sat up straighter, hoping posture would help.

Stephen seemed blissfully unaware. Or perfectly aware.

She sipped more wine.

By dessert, she was at a 7. Her thighs pressed together under the table. Her eyes fluttered closed as she breathed slowly through her nose, willing the ache to stay manageable.

Stephen reached for the check. “I’m just going to pop into the restroom before we go.”

She smiled. “I’ll wait for you out front.”

She didn’t trust herself to step into that bathroom.

Not because she thought she’d lose control, but because going now wouldn’t give her what she truly wanted. It wouldn’t push her far enough. Wouldn’t let her chase that intoxicating, near-orgasmic release she was so desperate for. Better to wait. Better to hold it a little longer—until she was back home, alone, and could savor every trembling second.

She stood carefully, walked to the front, and waited. When he reappeared, she smiled too widely and let him open the car door for her.

He didn’t say anything as he got in and pulled back onto the road.

But she saw it.

That tiny, knowing smile at the corner of his lips.

###

The car ride home began peacefully enough. At least from the outside.

Inside Evelyn's body, the story was different.

It started with a hum—not pain, not panic, just the dull heat of urgency beginning to tighten its grip. The seatbelt pressed across her belly. Her thighs remained clenched, discreetly, beneath her flowy dress. She breathed slowly, eyes fixed on the horizon. The car glided smoothly through residential streets.

Then they hit the highway.

And it wasn’t gliding anymore.

Stephen groaned low in his throat as they merged into crawling traffic. “What the hell…?”

Evelyn looked up. Four lanes, now a mess of brake lights. An accident ahead. She spotted the flashing hazard lights and the cones, the bottleneck funneling cars into a single lane.

“I think someone collided in the middle lane,” she murmured.

Stephen drummed his fingers on the wheel. “This is going to take a while.”

Evelyn said nothing.

But her bladder did.

The shift from sitting still to tension hit her like a new gear had been engaged. Suddenly the fullness wasn’t just present. It was radiating. Growing.

She pressed her knees together more tightly. Tried not to move. Tried not to think.

But the pressure had ideas of its own.

7 became 7.2.

Then 7.4.

She adjusted in her seat.

Stephen glanced over at her. “You alright?”

She nodded a bit too quickly. “Mhm. Just… full from lunch.”

That part wasn’t a lie.

Traffic edged forward ten feet.

Her bladder clenched again.

She tightened her jaw. She could feel the internal tremor beginning—that subtle but unmistakable shift when the body begins to lose confidence in your plans.

The next twenty minutes passed in unbearable slowness.

The air in the car thickened.

The buzz in her abdomen turned electric.

She shifted again. And again. Her heel dug against the floor mat. Her thighs tensed. She glanced over at Stephen, then away.

He was watching her now.

She tried to sit still.

7.6.

He turned the volume down on the radio.

Haha, I’ll take that as a compliment 😏 Thanks for reading -- Part 2 should be up tomorrow, see you then!

*008*2025-09-24 23:29

Thanks again for all the love on Part 1 — here’s Part 2, hot off the press 🥰 Hope you enjoy where it goes next—this one gets a little messy… Let me know if it earns me a few more “magnificent bastard” points 😉

He turned the volume down on the radio.

“You’re not just full from lunch,” he said mildly.

She didn’t respond.

“You didn’t go before we left.”

Still, she said nothing.

“And now you’re stuck in traffic. With me.”

His words landed in the charged quiet. Stephen cut her a pointed glance, waiting, not letting her slip past without acknowledgment.

Evelyn exhaled hard through her nose, as if frustrated with herself. “I was going to go. After we got home. I had this whole plan today—and then you invited me to lunch, and I couldn’t just… throw it all away.”

The words tumbled out too fast, too defensive. Even to her own ears, they sounded thin.

Stephen chuckled, shaking his head as if he couldn’t believe his luck. “Yes. Masterful planning, really. The kind of strategic genius they’ll be teaching in textbooks one day.”

She flushed, flustered now. “It was a good plan… who could’ve guessed we’d be stuck on the highway because of this—this stupid accident?”

His grin widened. “Careful setup, flawless execution. And look at you now, reaping the rewards. Go on, give yourself a pat on the back.”

She let out a long, shaky breath, feet bouncing restlessly against the floor as she rocked in her seat, one hand jammed between her legs. “Goddamnit,” she whined.

To Stephen, her frantic squirming was impossible to look away from—the quick kicks of her feet, the way her fist pressed hard against her dress, the helpless rhythm of her body fighting itself. The sight struck him as shameless, irresistible, and unbearably enticing. He chuckled again, unapologetically entertained.

“Having trouble?”

She shot him a glare. But there was no venom behind it. Only desperation.

8.0.

She couldn’t sit still now. Every bump in the road jostled her. Every stop and start of the car jolted the pressure higher. Her breath shortened. Her fingers gripped the seat.

At last the bottleneck cleared; they slipped past the collision site, traffic flowing smooth again. Relief should have come with it, but Evelyn’s body was past caring. She’d been here before, enough times to know what the tremors meant. She guessed she had maybe twenty minutes left in her. She glanced at the dash—fourteen minutes till home. Doable. She could survive fourteen. She had to.

Stephen tried to drive carefully, eyes flicking between the traffic and her trembling form. He wanted to spare her the jolts, even as the sight of her squirming made it nearly impossible to think straight. Heat throbbed low in his body, straining against his slacks, but he forced his hands steady on the wheel.

The road showed no mercy. A pothole caught them hard, the jolt ripping through her.

She gasped as heat burst between her legs in a sudden, uncontrollable spurt.

“Stephen—I’m leaking.”

He kept his voice calm, though his grin betrayed him. “You’re almost home. Worst case, it’s just another two hundred bucks for cleaning the car. Won’t break the bank.” His eyes twinkled as he added, “And you know I’d never let you live it down anyway.”

9.2.

They turned into their neighborhood.

Each speed bump was agony. Evelyn winced, folded forward, nearly moaning as her overfull bladder screamed at her. Another spurt escaped—longer this time. Hot, wet, and terrifying. She clenched harder, desperately willing her exhausted sphincter to cooperate.

It didn’t.

Another leak followed the next corner. Then another when Stephen lightly tapped the brakes. One hand clawed at the seat for balance, the other pressed hard between her thighs—but it wasn’t enough. Another hot trickle forced its way out. With a shaky gasp she abandoned balance altogether, jamming both hands down, fingers digging in as if sheer force could hold it back. But her efforts were futile. It was like trying to plug a dam with a tissue.

Her muscles were weakening fast—fatigued from the prolonged effort, spasming now in warning.

She wasn’t going to make it. Not unless a miracle arrived.

Her willpower screamed at her to hold it just a bit longer, to keep her dignity intact and not soak Stephen’s passenger seat—again. But her body had stopped listening. The involuntary clenching, the weakening, the betrayal of her own anatomy made it unmistakable.

She was losing the battle. And she knew it.

9.5.

9.6.

The moment the car stopped in the driveway, she threw open the door.

Didn’t wait.

Didn’t look back.

She hobbled to the door in a half-crouch, her soft beige dress clinging to her thighs, her panties already damp and sticky beneath it. Her hair—pulled neatly into a clip hours ago—was coming loose now as she rocked with every step. One hand was jammed hard into herself through the thin fabric, fighting for pressure that barely held, while the other rifled frantically in her bag for the keys. Only then did it hit her—she should have grabbed them in the car. But of course she hadn’t. There’d been no room in her head for foresight, not with every nerve screaming at her to just hold on. Her sandals slapped the pavement with each uneven step, splashed now by the fresh leaks forcing their way past her clenched fingers.

Keys.

[End of Part 2]

I’ll be back soon with Part 3 — Evelyn’s day isn’t quite finished yet 😜. Thanks again for reading, and I can’t wait to share how it all wraps up! 🌺

*011*2025-09-26 01:25

Glad you’re enjoying their dynamic! 😅 I couldn’t resist leaving them (and you all) hanging right at that moment of desperation. Part 3 will definitely reward your patience -- promise!

*014*2025-09-27 15:51

Here we are -- Part 3, the finale! 🥹 Thanks for the patience -- the last edit took me a while. Fingers crossed it hits the right notes for you.

Keys. She found them.

Fumbled.

Dropped them. The fall of the keys hit the cement with a soft clatter.

She bent down to retrieve them.

And felt it: another sharp, hot spurt. This one lasted a full three seconds, pouring into her panties before she could choke it off. Her whole body seized. She clenched, hard, every muscle in her core begging her sphincter to cooperate.

It barely did.

She snatched the keys up, her hand shaking violently now. One last sprint. She staggered to the front door, trembling, thighs slick and trembling with effort.

But the moment she reached the threshold, it happened.

Her body betrayed her.

She was still standing on the porch, still fully exposed to the quiet world around her, when the next spurt came. And this one didn’t stop. Panic jolted through her—not here, not like this, not on the front step where anyone could see. Max across the street. Or Mrs. Brown at her window. The thought made her stomach twist even as the flood broke loose.

She tried. God, she tried. Clenched so hard her abdomen spasmed. Willed her fatigued pelvic floor to obey. But her bladder was beyond reason, beyond will. That final spurt became a stream, and the stream became a flood.

Hot urine burst past her, gushing down her thighs, soaking through her already-sodden panties, darkening the back of her soft beige dress. It hissed audibly as it splattered against the stone porch and pooled around her sandals.

She let out a tiny, strangled noise—a sound of shock, of surrender, of shame tangled with devastating pleasure.

Her legs buckled, feet slipping slightly in the growing puddle beneath her. She grabbed the doorframe for balance, her whole body trembling.

It kept going. The release was furious, involuntary, magnificent in its humiliation. The air smelled faintly of it now, and she knew without looking that the dark wetness had bloomed everywhere across the backs of her thighs.

When it finally ended, she was drenched. Her legs were shaking with the aftershocks. The puddle around her feet had spread in all directions, glistening in the daylight.

And then she looked up.

Stephen was standing in the garage doorway. He must have been there for the entire minute it took her to empty, watching silently as she came undone.

He had seen everything.

And still—he looked at her like she was something divine.

His voice was quiet. Reverent.

"So beautiful when you let go."

He was by her side in an instant.

Stephen strode forward without hesitation, not sparing a single glance at the spreading puddle on the stone porch. He wrapped his arms around her, soaking dress and all, pulling her against his chest as if she were the most precious thing he’d ever held.

Evelyn trembled, unable to meet his eyes. Her cheeks burned, body still shivering with aftershocks.

But he didn’t flinch. He didn’t recoil.

He kissed her hair. Whispered into the crown of her head. "You're perfect."

And somehow, she believed him.

—

He helped her inside, one steady arm around her waist. The tile just past the threshold caught the runoff from her dress, darkening instantly. He didn’t care. He reached down, undid the zip at her side, and let the drenched fabric fall to the floor with a soft, wet slap.

She was a mess. A dripping, panties-soaked, shaking mess.

He cupped her cheek. “Shower,” he said simply, and guided her there.

The water was warm by the time he turned the tap. He eased her soaked panties down gently, reverently. No teasing. Just care. Her body carried the evidence of strain—quivering muscles, flushed skin, the faint ache of overworked control—and he kissed each trembling mark of it away. Then he washed her slowly, hands lathering her shoulders, her back, her thighs.

All the while, his voice stayed low, just for her, threading through the steam and spray.

“Thank you for today.”

“For making our lives fun. For bringing your curiosity and creativity into everything we do.”

“I love that we get to explore this together. I love you more than you’ll ever know.”

By the time they stepped out and he toweled her dry, Evelyn had gone quiet—boneless and spent, but wrapped in something peaceful now.

He guided her to bed, tucked the blanket around her with care, and sat beside her. When her eyes met his, he bent closer with a sly grin.

“You know,” he said conversationally, “careful setup, flawless execution—and maybe next time, add a diaper?”

Evelyn groaned, mortified. But the laughter came next. A soft, breathy release.

She laughed into the pillow.

“Maybe,” she whispered.

Stephen kissed her again. “I’m canceling the rest of my meetings. That’s why I’m the boss—I get to spend the afternoon with my perfect, soaked, utterly disarmed wife.”

And she smiled—truly, deeply smiled—for the first time that day.

That’s the end of Her Plan! Honestly, I never thought I’d have the courage to post here, and I didn’t expect such a warm response. I’m really touched (and a little stunned!) by how kind everyone’s been. Thank you for reading and making me feel so, so welcome.

I’d love to hear what stood out to you most across the three parts—the slow build, the breaking point, or Stephen’s response afterward. Hearing what worked (or even what didn’t!) helps me figure out what to lean into as I refine my writing and keep learning the ropes for future stories 🌺

So romantic, I loved reading it especially the end. You really do so well to bring out how romantic wetting can be. My only question would be how Evelyn seems to want to hold and possibly on her own keeping it from Stephen. Plus I love how much she wets and stylishly Thanks again so much for th romance and happy to chat more about it, Flora. Best!

}}

Thank you so much for this 💕 I’m really glad the ending landed for you -- the aftercare has always felt just as important to me as the desperation itself. It’s not all that common to see omo written with romance and tenderness woven through; a lot of fetish stories lean on the spectacle of the hold or the accident, while the emotional side gets skimmed over. I wanted to play in that in-between space, where it can be messy and romantic, fun and loving. Why can’t it be both?

As for Evelyn keeping it to herself -- that was deliberate. After the last "car accident" (ha. ha.) Stephen still teases her about, she didn’t want to hand him another chance to gloat. So this became her private little challenge... though of course, between her body and the lane closures, the plan never stood a chance 😉

That blend of intensity and tenderness is where I was hoping to build into this particular piece -- and the fact that you recognized it as a reader means a lot to me.

This shower is magical.

It is possible to run a pipe from the shower back to the hot water cylinder ( a secondary return in UK plumbing ). This system provides instant hot water at the shower. In the UK it's use is generally limited to large houses and commercial buildings. Hope l don't get kicked out for a non omo post. I really do like this story, thank you

Haha, you all caught me! 😅 That’s what happens when I don’t have an editor hovering over my shoulder. I definitely meant the “pulling the nub to switch to the shower spray” moment, but reading it back (and seeing your comments) I can totally see how it came across like some kind of magical pre-heated plumbing setup.

Thank you so much for pointing it out -- and for taking the time to read in the first place! I’ll fix the line in my own copy on my computer, but I think I’ll leave the version here untouched, so anyone scrolling later can have a little chuckle at my expense too. Consider it part of the charm. 😉

Again love the intimacy and romance Flora, but also wanted to ask about whether Stephen was into omo or getting into it slowly as Evelyn wets?

}}

Thank you 💕 That’s exactly the angle I had in mind writing it -- Stephen isn’t carrying a secret lifelong omo kink, he’s turned on because Evelyn is. He adores watching her explore, and her excitement makes it hot for him too. Kind of like giving oral: the act itself might not be the thrill, but seeing your partner melt absolutely is. So yes, he’s into omo through her. You read between the lines perfectly -- I wanted that foundation of love and trust to extend into their kink play, to make it feel more intimate, realistic, and powerful. I’m so glad it came through as flawlessly executed (🤭) this time. Yay me!
