I’ve been a bit quiet here lately—been working on a 6k-word piece in orgasm denial. But I’m back with something new for the omo crowd. Enjoy the ride! 🌺

###

The teacup ride screeched as it began to slow, but Janice was already moving before the wheel completed its last rotation. She popped up like a cork, one hand on the center wheel for balance, feet hitting the spinning floor with zero regard for momentum or safety instructions. The ride operator didn’t even get to lift the bar before she’d hopped over it like it was optional scenery.

She didn’t bolt far—just hovered two steps down the ramp, pacing like she was waiting for a starter pistol.

She didn’t look back. Didn’t check whether the other two were even upright. Hair wind-mussed, grin feral, jittering in place like she’d break out in hives if she stopped moving.

“Jan-nice!” Gloria called after her, clutching the safety bar like she’d survived warfare. “Don’t leave Sam in there like a coffee stain stuck to the cup!”

Sam didn’t hurry. She stood with the calm energy of a cat stepping off a windowsill, smooth and deliberate. No wobble. No flail. Just a quiet nod to the exhausted-looking teenager running the ride.

“Gloria the goldfish,” Sam said mildly. “You left your bowl behind.”

Gloria walked on.

“Glory—Bowl!” Sam called out, louder. Heads turned.

Janice snorted, grin widening—trust Sam to slip that in.

Gloria froze, eyes widening. “Oh shit—”

She twisted, nearly tripping over her own shoelaces as she dove past Sam back into the teacup to retrieve her ivory tote that could blind a bee. She clutched it to her chest with theatrical dignity.

“Goldfish have excellent water retention, thank you,” she sniffed. “Call me that again and I’ll hydrate your shoes personally.”

“Save the splash zone for someone who deserves it,” Janice called over her shoulder.

Down the ramp, Janice finally turned—but only so she could walk backward while still moving at full speed through the crowd. No pause. No apology.

“Ugh, I think my stomach’s still orbiting,” she said, rubbing her midsection in mock drama. “If I’m ingesting organs for dinner tonight, I’d rather they not be my own…”

“Me too! I’m starving,” Gloria chimed in, hooking an arm around Janice.

“Man meat’s…” Janice declared, voice rising in a broadcast crescendo, “way more fun to chew.”

Gloria gave Janice a shove, sending them tumbling toward a middle-aged woman whose blouse looked like it had been ironed with calculated precision. Her spine was straight as a ruler, hair perfect. The woman cut them a side-eye meant to curdle blood.

It bounced off the pair, unnoticed.

Sam watched the chaos unfold, a smile playing at her lips. She caught up and slipped between them like gravity itself assigning her referee duty.

The three of them disappeared into the swell of neon and noise, elbows knocking, voices already fighting to be heard over the music as they bulldozed toward food.

—

The midway was a river of noise and light. Strings of bulbs blinked overhead like caffeine-drunk constellations, and every step smelled like sugar, grease, and burnt popcorn.

Gloria led the charge now, her arm looped through Janice’s as if towing her by sheer appetite. Sam trailed half a step behind, steady as a metronome amid chaos.

“We should eat something real,” Sam said, voice flat but carrying easily over the crowd. “There’s a bistro across the street.”

Janice recoiled like the word itself had teeth. “No way. Four-course menu with wine pairings? My wallet would flatline.”

“That?” Gloria pointed a finger between her front teeth. “That’d fill this gap at best—takes them two hours just to serve three leaves on a plate.”

Janice barked a laugh. “You mean your diastema big enough to store regret?”

“Whoa!” Gloria ducked. “Big words incoming!”

“While Janice apparently already ingested an entire dinosaur,” Sam said dryly, rolling her eyes. “The rest of us still need food—and the bistro is a no.”

Collective ascent. Synchronized turn. Three heads pivoted in perfect unison—away from the linen tablecloths and polite lighting.

The smell of frying dough grew stronger with every step—a sweet, buttery lure for the goldfish and her crew. The stall’s sign blinked FUNNEL CAKES / COTTON CANDY / SLUSHIES / ICE CREAM, all in aggressive pink. A teenage worker stood inside wearing an expression that suggested he’d seen horrors.

Janice grinned, triumphant. “Finally, cuisine that understands us.”

Gloria threw both arms wide. “Dinner of champions.”

Sam sighed—but she was smiling when she stepped up to order.

The air by the stall was thick with sugar and heat. Oil hissed. Powdered sugar drifted through the lights like carnival snow.

“One large lemon slushy, please,” Gloria declared, already halfway through pulling a straw from the dispenser.

The teenager behind the counter didn’t even blink. “What size?”

Gloria straightened into her best teacher’s-pet impression—hands folded like she expected a gold star.

“A lemon slushy that contains its own ecosystem,” she said, all bright eyes and earnest nodding.

He regarded her in silence.

Gloria sighed. “Large.” Then, muttering as she fished for her wallet: “the walking dead is seriously no fun to watch at all.”

Janice leaned over the counter next, scanning the tubs with a predator’s focus. “Triple scoop. Chocolate, vanilla, and whatever that purple one is—surprise me. And hit me with everything that crunches, sparkles, or has the potential to chip a tooth.”

The boy turned to Sam last, clearly praying she’d be normal.

“Funnel cake,” she said. “Extra powdered sugar.”

He nodded like she’d just restored his faith in humanity and moved to the fryer.

Janice elbowed Gloria. “See? Even the fry guy gets it. Messy girls make more fun.”

“Thanks,” Sam said, accepting her funnel cake from the counter. A gust of air immediately frosted her light blue shirt in white. She blinked down at herself. “Messy girls… do more laundry.”

“Ha! Powdered Sam—Hole!” Gloria cackled, mid-sip of slushy. “Nope. Doesn’t work. Damn.”

“Wow. Witness the wit of a fishbrain,” Sam muttered.

Janice snorted into her cone, licking a drip before it reached her wrist. “God, I love us.”

They wandered off with their spoils—three small comets of sugar and neon weaving into the crowd, laughter bright against the music.

—

Frosting puffed around Sam like smoke signals every time she spoke. She juggled the collapsing plate, a plastic fork, and her dignity, losing the fight with all three.

Gloria, meanwhile, looked smugly composed—slushy in one hand, straw wedged between her front teeth.

“And that is why you get something portable,” she said, lifting the cup like a trophy. “One hand. Zero utensils. Darwin-approved.”

Sam didn’t look up. “Sure. Until those twenty-four ounces hit your kidneys and you start waddling like an eighty-year-old doing water aerobics.”

Janice burst out laughing, nearly inhaling her ice cream. “Oh, she’s right, Goldfish. That’s the deluxe bladder-buster combo you’re holding.”

Gloria scoffed and took a long, deliberate pull from her cup, the straw squealing in protest. “Ha! Behold—Bladder of Steel. Excellent water retention.”

They moved with the line toward the Ferris wheel, half-eating, half-dodging elbows. Janice’s cone was vanishing at an indecent pace; she’d started licking it slow, head tilted, making brief, deliberate eye contact with every passerby.

“For God’s sake,” Sam muttered. “Wrong food group for that performance, babe.”

Janice didn’t break stride. “Practice makes perfe—erted!”

“Keep that up and the ice cream’s gonna start dripping upwards,” Sam deadpanned.

Gloria choked on her drink, wheezing laughter. “Goddammit—you’re making me squirt yellow liquid everywhere.”

Janice answered with an exaggerated moan that sent the trio into another fit of giggles. Somewhere in the chaos, a sizable blob of strawberry sauce slid off Sam’s funnel cake and splattered dead-center on her shirt.

She paused, stared down at the damage, then sighed. “Shit. I’ll need to give this a rinse under the tap before it hits the hamper…”

Gloria pointed with her straw. “Bathroom’s that way?”

They looked: a row of gray porta-potties hunched at the edge of the lights, doors creaking like dying whales with an audience forming fast.

Sam waved her fork dismissively. “I’ll dry eventually.”

Janice snorted. “Adds flavor. That crust pairs nicely with humiliation.”

They shuffled forward with the crowd. Sam wrestled another bite. Janice savored what was left of her cone. Gloria kept sipping her slushy like a victory lap, entirely unfazed by the warning in her friends’ smirks.

By the time they reached the loading platform, Sam was cramming the last sticky bites into her mouth, Janice was licking melted trails from her wrist, and Gloria uncapped her cup to slurp the last of the neon liquid with a satisfied gulp.

They tossed the remains into the bin by the gate.

Gloria’s cup was empty.

Her bladder soon not.

The operator waved them forward. The car rocked as the door closed, sealing them in. The wheel shuddered, caught, and began to climb—each arc a slow tightening of fate.

—

The wheel creaked down through its final turns, the city a blur of pink and gold behind the cage bars. By the time their car kissed the platform, Gloria was bouncing her knee in rhythm with the music below—restless, jittery—definitely, just ferris wheel excitement.

The moment the latch clicked open, she was out first. “Zipper. Now.”

Janice blinked at her. “Straight from gentle spin to vomit simulator? Did you forget you just ate, Goldfish?”

“Thanks for asking—I’m nice and full,” Gloria said, already marching toward the shrieking metal beast spinning at the end of the midway.

Sam followed with the weariness of someone resigned to friendship as an extreme sport. “You do realize that thing’s basically a human blender.”

“Purr-fect,” Janice purred, somehow still licking the last of her cone from her thumb. “I’ve always wanted to see what flavor I am.”

They joined the Zipper queue, hemmed in by bodies and the smell of oil and ozone. The line crawled forward in fits; the ride screeched and hissed overhead like tortured steel.

Gloria nodded at Sam’s chest. “Hey, maybe if we brought water bottles on this ride, you could give your shirt a wash mid-spin!”

Sam glanced down at the dried strawberry mark and didn’t miss a beat. “At least I still have a part-time job to afford detergent—unlike Janice here, Miss I-got-fired-from-Burger-King.”

Janice’s head snapped up. “That wasn’t my fault! I was stuck on the highway! And I forgot my phone! Not my fault that dickhead manager thought I ditched my shift on purpose—”

The queue shifted forward. The argument kept pace. People ahead started glancing back; the operator looked vaguely afraid.

When the gate opened, they piled into the cage still mid-debate, voices overlapping with the rattle of chains.

The door slammed. Locks clanked.

“I blame the jam!” Janice shouted as the Zipper jolted to life.

The world inverted. Screams, laughter, centrifugal chaos—three voices tumbling in and out of gravity.

“Holy shit!” Gloria yelled over the roar. “This thing sloshes everything around—regret! Regret!”

Janice was howling, hair whipping across her face. “You were the one who wanted the front loading!”

Sam’s voice floated up from somewhere below—or above; hard to tell anymore. “Hope the steel holds.”

The car spun again, flipping them end over end. Gloria’s laughter came out half-scream, half-plea, her stomach and every other organ doing gymnastics. Janice whooped like she was auditioning for a demolition derby. Sam clung to the side bar with the calm of a woman writing her will.

“Made to order!” Janice crowed as they spun sideways. “Three scoops, coming up!”

“Don’t you—” Gloria started, but the rest vanished to gravity.

By the time the ride slowed, her laughter had thinned to breathless giggles. When the cage swung open, they spilled out in zigzags, hair flying, knees uncooperative.

Janice threw her hands up. “Stomache of steel, baby!”

Sam staggered beside her. “I’m dry.”

Gloria just smiled a little too wide, knees knocking together in the shuffle toward solid ground. “Again?” she said, voice soft, eyes already scanning for the next ride. Her hands reached for the railing by the exit—and froze.

“Okay—ow?” She exhaled through a laugh, thighs pressing in a little tighter. “That centrifuge might have rearranged my insides. Slightly. All good!”

Janice didn’t slow. Sam looked at Gloria.

Gloria straightened, shaking it off. “Whatever. BUMPER CARS!” She threw her arms up like a victorious lunatic. “Here I come!”

Janice was already scanning the crowd, zeroing in on a knot of guys near the line. “Bumper cars or boy collisions. Either works. I can hit on them, or they can hit on me—equal opportunity physics, baby.”

Sam groaned, adjusting her powdered shirt like it was armor. “Can we just not end the night this once with you grinding gears and a stranger again?”

“No promises,” Janice said, winking.

And off they went again—three blurs of noise and sticky fingers, swerving straight toward another round of chaos.

Behind them, the row of gray porta-potties hunched in silence, doors creaking softly as the dying whales of the midway bid them well.

[end of Part 1]

Part 2’s coming shortly—I’m letting Gloria process her slushy a little longer before we continue. 😉 If anything in this chaos made you smile, wince, or look up new vocab, I’m always curious to hear it.

What a promising part 1! I really love how the girls interact with each other and how you convey how much fun they're having. Also, something about that dialogue and the metaphors seems to be hinting at something.... Whatever could it be? 😄 Great writing!

I had way too much fun with their puns and sideways subtext. Now that their dynamic’s properly set, Part 2 is where the slushy moves along and things start to heat up.

Thank you for your encouragement!

Edit: Part 2’s already submitted, by the way—just waiting for it to clear the queue.

Carnival Goldfish — Part 2

The midway gets meaner, and Gloria’s bladder gets… an opinion. Or two. Or ten.

—

The Bumper Cars queue coiled under flickering bulbs, each bass jolt from the ride ahead rattling the metal cage like a heartbeat. Gloria shifted from foot to foot, leaning, bouncing off, leaning again against the rail.

Janice noticed first. “Cute little dance you’ve got going here.”

“I’m not dancing,” Gloria said, tugging at her T-shirt hem. “Oh did you see that cute guy that walked by just now? He totally seems your type. Although I think he was checking out Sam—but then maybe he’s just staring at the unfortunate newly decorated red add-ons.”

Sam arched an eyebrow. “Wow. Dancing and rapping. Talents.”

Gloria swung her tote in front of her, still doing her little two-step shuffle, laughing as she eyed the heads in the queue ahead. “This ride takes forever to load, huh? At least we’re getting our money’s worth. But damn, this line’s crawling—might take longer to get in than that bistro’s lunch menu, wine pairings and dessert included.”

Janice bumped her hip with a smirk. “You know, maybe you could’ve caught the attention of a millionaire type in there and signed a contract before the day’s done—like Ana.”

“Uh—what?” Gloria blinked.

Janice opened her mouth to reply—but a kid nearby tipped his soda, a pale yellow splash of Mountain Dew spreading across the pavement. The hiss of carbonation cut clean through the carnival noise, brief and sharp. The line shuffled forward. The fizz flattened, leaving a wide sticky patch glinting like Christmas presents after Boxing Day.

They reached the gate. Gloria darted to the nearest car in quick, chihuahua-sized steps. She parked herself neatly in her seat, hands gripping the steering wheel, knuckles white, as the loud but muffled safety instructions were delivered through low-quality speakers by the most unenthusiastic voice imaginable.

The ride burst into motion—chaos in a cage. Sam drove clean and precise, the strategist. Janice, of course, had one target.

“Bullseye! Right into the fishbowl!”

“Fuck—”

Janice was already reversing, eyes alight with pure villainy.

“Ow! No! Goddammit, go fucking pick on someone else!” Gloria shouted.

Janice went for her again anyway.

Sam swerved in and sideswiped them both. “Hell yeah! Two for one!”

Gloria’s tote slid to the floor of the car in a state of surrender.

When the buzzer finally sounded, Gloria rose stiffly, rubbing her hands once on her thigh.

She joined the others at the exit, fiddling with the strings on her tote as she walked.

—

The midway roared around them again—music, chatter, the metallic shriek of rides shifting in the summer evening air.

“Holy cow, you guys are mean,” Gloria said, chihuahuaing into step behind the others. She gave her thigh one last absent rub, the ghost of motion from the bumper-car brawl. “You’re like—” she paused, considering carefully how the next line would land best, “...messing with my brain here.”

Janice was already peeling off toward the next ride. “Oh! Finally! Lines are the one exception where it’s better to be short than long!” she called over her shoulder, beelining for the Viking Ship swinging like a deranged pendulum at the far end of the midway. The line there was mercifully shorter than most—and the line for the end row had no one at all.

Sam turned back, and saw the back of Gloria’s head. In the background, a row of barely discernable grey structures loomed, with a cluster of humanoid silhouettes layered in front.

“Want me to call Janice back?” She asked, voice mild.

“All good!” Gloria said, eyes bright and eager. “Let’s go.”

She linked arms with Sam and walked at a leisurely pace toward Janice, who was already bouncing and gesturing wildly at the head of the Viking Ship, where the gates had just swung open.

They slid into the very back row—prime estates for masochists and thrill junkies. The metal lap bar descended with a hollow clang, stopping several inches above their thighs, not exactly the most… reassuring form of protection.

“Comforting,” Sam muttered, testing the wobble.

“Authentic pirate danger,” Janice said, winking.

“Mm-hmm.” Gloria agreed.

A mechanical groan signalled the start. The ship creaked forward once, twice, testing its chain like an animal straining at a leash. Then the motors caught.

The swing rose slowly—a gentle sway. Gloria whooped on the first climb, voice cutting through the breeze. “Hooray for steel!”

They watched the other end’s teens throw up their hands, whooping in unison.

The next swing carried them higher. “Erm,” she called out, as the ride carried them forward toward the other peak, “Alu—” they dropped, weightless. “...minum.”.

Janice cackled beside her. “Downgrade accepted!”

The ship swept back again, higher still.

It swung to the other side.

“Plastic wrap.” Gloria supplied as they returned on the next upswing.

Another rise, another drop—longer, sharper.

Yet another cycle.

“WHOO!” Janice howled, hair whipping, half standing as the ride took them to the 10 o’clock arc, their body defying gravity for a beat.

Sam glanced sideways at Gloria.

When the brakes finally caught, the ship groaned to a stop, shuddering through its last few arcs. The lap bar lifted with an unconvincing click.

Janice leapt out first, triumphant. “Captain Janice conquers the seas!”

Gloria rose, her hands still caught around the tote’s straps where they’d been wedged between her thighs. She slipped them free and swung the bag over her shoulder, returning once again to dry land—for now.

“Bathroom break,” Sam announced.

Janice groaned from ahead. “But the teacup line’s short—I need another pour!”

Sam didn’t even turn. “Bathroom.”

Gloria looked at Sam’s retreating form and followed, shuffling along as the music faded behind her, Janice’s pattering footsteps closing in.

—

The path out of the ride dumped them straight into the midway’s glare again—squeals, a juggler, mechanical hiss, and the thick, musky humidity of summer settling in. Sam led the trio toward the far corner, back to the perch of the grey porta-potties.

“Oh joy,” Gloria muttered, toes stomping a tuft of under-watered grass on the dirt.

“Fun.” Sam said dryly. “The only line longer than the Zipper.”

Janice finally caught up and collided into Gloria, draping an arm over her shoulder.

“How’s the saran wrap holding up?”

Gloria winced. “Ow! Now you’re right in the splash—” she held out her hand, closed her eyes, “zone. Like a ham…mock?”

Janice heard the sounds from the nearby carnival game booth—one of those water-gun races where you aim at a clown’s mouth and inflate a balloon until it pops. Bells clanged, whistles blew, water hissed through metal nozzles in rhythmic spurts. She grinned like the devil at an open mic.

“Ohh. You’ve got to admire that aim.” She stared unapologetically at a dad unleashing a perfect, unbroken stream into the target. “Look at that control! GO DAD—ten out of ten!” she yelled, turning heads. “Yup. Volume tracks. Large famil—”

Sam grabbed Janice’s loose crop top and yanked her sideways, sending her stumbling a few steps—right into the gap the line had just opened.

“Tissue… paper,” Gloria moaned. “Might have to ditch this line for the Zip… per line—dry my stuff out after I drown in?—public.”

“Thirteen, fourteen,” Janice whispered, counting heads ahead. “Fifteen!” she supplied helpfully—just as one of the balloons burst, a wet, explosive pop followed by a fountain splash.

The line lurched forward amid more droplets landing—six more balloons overfilled to the point of bursting for the sake of sweet and unforgettable carnival memories. A little girl with twin pink Hello Kitty clips darted past the crowd, pigtails bouncing, and executed a flawless headbutt straight into Gloria’s bladder before veering off again, giggling.

“Oof!” Gloria bent double, knees crossing into impossible geometry, while an exhausted father dashed after the vanishing form of entropy made flesh. His shoe left a clear mark on Gloria’s tote strewn on the lawn beside her.

Sam’s voice floated down, wry. “And—pretzeled out by a first grader. Tragic.”

“Pret—zel…” Gloria returned shakily between gasps, “with… a sog—gy bottom. Soon.”

Janice eyed the goldfish-flavoured pretzel, then turned around and tapped the shoulder of the young mother with a toddler just ahead in line.

“Excuse me.” She said with the exemplary professionalism of Burger King’s former Employee of the Year, “My friend there… is about to reenact your kid’s potty-training arc. Would you mind?”

The mom smiled, warm and good-natured, waving them ahead. “No worries—we can wait.”

Janice gave a crisp little “after you” gesture, punctuated by a theatrical bow worthy of bistro atmosphere, inviting her friends to move ahead in the queue. Sam snatched the tote off the floor and offered Gloria a steady elbow. Gloria folded, then hauled herself upright again, leaning on Sam as she hobbled—one hand clamped between her thighs—past the mother and daughter.

“Thanks.”

Janice engaged her next customer—a cute guy in his twenties with wavy brown hair and disarming dimples. “Emergency triage—large lemon-slushy situation.” She pointed toward the water-gun booth. “Mind if we skip you so my friend doesn’t become one of those balloons?”

The cute guy flashed a smile with enough voltage to initiate Janice into puddlehood and stepped aside.

Sam guided the hunched-over Gloria forward, hovering close as Gloria let go of her elbow and jammed both hands to her crotch.

Two down. One teenager to go.

“On a scale of lol to viral, how funny do you think it is if she explodes here?” Janice asked, jerking a thumb at the whimpering, wiggling form beside her. “Do us a mercy?”

Mission accomplished.

From her front row seat, Gloria’s eyes locked on the row of closed grey doors.

One of the little red “occupied” tabs swam in and out of focus—ordinary plastic, but it might as well have been a stoplight. The bulbs overhead burned too bright; the edges of her vision pulled inward until only that red square remained. Her fingers, welded between her thighs, tingled stiffly. Her forehead grew slick, arms rising in goosebumps despite the humid night.

Her heart thundered—too fast, too loud. Her mouth hung open, dragging shallow breaths of muggy air. A deep, spreading heat thrummed low in her abdomen, heavy and alive, as if her bladder itself were swelling. She felt it reach downward, a molten channel tracing a single path straight to her core.

“Aah—” Another sound broke from her throat. The sensation ebbed, then surged back even harder. She buckled into Sam’s supporting arms, light-headed, the world swaying with her. The dull ache had deepened into a steady presence now, radiating through her abdomen, down between her legs—unrelenting.

She locked her muscles, motionless, bracing for the next wave. She willed her body to obey, even as control slipped through her grasp—that tiny gatekeeper muscle trembling, near defeat. Another brief, searing leak, joined the damage already there, its wetness clinging to her. The cold slushy making a warm reappearance.

Is it showing through yet?

One of the doors opened.

Sam and Janice watched their friend pull a perfect deer-in-the-headlights impression for a full two seconds. Then she jerked into motion—legs pressed tight, steps small and rigid. She stumbled forward, three stiff strides toward the open stall, the door of salvation itself.

She disappeared inside, the spring catching behind her, the little green “vacant” tab unnoticed by anyone.

The teenager finished up and vanished into the crowd.

The cute guy emerged next, not sparing Janice so much as a glance.

The mom with the toddler was still in her stall—no surprise there.

From inside, Gloria’s voice floated out. “Status report: ninety percent success, ten percent tragicomedy.”

Janice snorted. “Printing T-shirts that say Bladder of Steel—ish.”

“If you're done in there, I need to go too.” Sam said dryly.

Gloria emerged grinning, tugging at her shirt. “My yellow pants stain is still smaller than your red one. I win.”

“Ketchup and mustard,” Janice chimed. “Sadly lacking sausage.”

[End]

A few people have asked where to find the orgasm-denial story I mentioned, so I’ll leave the link here. It’s a slow-burn, intimate D/s piece about a married couple—much closer in tone to Her Plan Backfires than the ride you were just on—but if you like control dynamics with a twist of humour, you’ll probably enjoy it.

Naah man it took 2 weeks to get approved. Why does all good things have to wait so long 😭😭😭

Honestly, after writing Gloria’s bathroom queue ordeal, the approval wait felt thematically appropriate. Though perhaps less fun since this one doesn't involve balloon splashes... Or soggy bottoms. 🤭
