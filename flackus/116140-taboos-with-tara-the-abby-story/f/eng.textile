Taboos with Tara: The Abby Story

It had been about one week since Tara and I’s encounter with David and Sarah. An encounter, thanks to Tara, had become wonderfully weird and sexy.

That day, and a few days during the week, we enjoyed a little more wet fun in privacy. The second we walked through my front door, we were all over each other. Our clothes started coming off, but I told Tara to keep her wet jeans on for a little bit longer.

The rest of that story comes later. My plan is to make this a series, and, being the cinemaphile that I am, I going to Tarantino this shit : )

Tara and I decided to take a little road trip with no specific itinerary. We drove about 75 miles to the town that was home to the university from which we’d both graduated with Bachelor’s degrees. Bachelor’s of Arts and Sciences for me; Fine Arts for Tara. The town had a lot of parks and attractions. The university seemed to have grown exponentially since we’d graduated. The community was proud of the university, and the town was one of the main reasons for the university’s expansion. The university had given back to the small town, so the town grew in pace with the university. An amazing symbiotic relationship that made the town thrive.

It was a Sunday, so we decided to go to University Lake, which was within walking distance from the football stadium. During football season, the parking lot and the areas surrounding the stadium were packed with tailgaters and spectators. Football season would be starting soon, so, for at least a couple weeks, this section of campus would be relatively vacant. There were still students meandering around campus on their two day break from academia for the week. The weather was pleasant: sunny, but with a nice breeze. A perfect day for being outside. Tara and I sat at a picnic table in the shade, and we had a view of the lake.

Before our trip to the lake, we’d eaten at our favorite sandwich shop. We sat at the picnic table, sipping from our to-go cups. We didn’t talk for a while. We sat enjoying the relative peace and quiet. This lack of conversation wasn’t awkward. Tara and I weren’t the types of friends who felt the need to fill silence with banal conversation. There was no tension in the silence. Even though we were now friends who’d had sex and enjoyed a particular fetish over the past week, neither of us felt the need to place any labels on it. I’d always disliked the term friends with benefits. In my mind, Tara and I were intimate friends. Seemed more succinct that way. Nothing complicated. We never had a conversation about our relationship, but we were only about a week into it.

Tara wore light-colored cargo pants and a gray t-shirt with one word printed in white in lowercase letters: “maybe.” Despite her straying from her customary jeans, I was pleased with the change. The pants fit her nicely. Her favorite body part (for both of us) was accentuated fantastically in those pants. I wore jeans and a dark gray t-shirt sporting the name of the university in blank print across the front. School spirit.

We sat sipping our drinks and watching various configurations of college-aged people stroll by: laughing, chatting, faces glancing down at their phones, more laughing. A few lone runners and joggers pranced by, focused, with ubiquitous earbuds wedged in place. Neither Tara nor I had been runners. We both liked to stay fit, but we’d both agreed that running was more work than we were willing to commit to. Tara became focused on a trio of female university students walking by. She gestured in their general direction.

“Freshmen, you think?”

“Most likely.”

Another few minutes passed as we watched them. We were able to pick up some of their conversation. It was mostly about how drunk they’d gotten last night. They didn’t seem to lack any spring in their respective steps, so, they either didn’t get as drunk as they claimed, or they handled hangovers better than we did at their age.

Ah. College.

“I was just thinking,” Tara said. “I wonder how many of these kids have gotten so trashed that they’ve pissed their pants.”

(Tara and I are both in a early 30s, so we reserve the right to refer to college-age students as ‘kids.’)

Since Tara’s pants wetting, I was now hyperaware of all things pants wetting. I liked where this was going. During our time in college, we had witnessed numerous incidents such as these. Guys or girls so inebriated that they either didn’t possess the wherewithal to make it to the restroom in time, or had just passed out drunk in the clothes they were wearing. Despite their drunken slumbers, a full bladder needed relief. In those situations, bladders will let go - pee soaked clothes, beds, couches, floors were the aftermath.

“Probably more than most are willing to admit,” I replied.

“I hope, when that happened, not all of them felt mortified by it,” she said. “I would hope they could just laugh about it after they cleaned up.”

Compassionate Tara.

I simply nodded and glanced over at Tara. Her cute nose was crinkled at the bridge, and her lips were slightly pursed. I had known her long enough to know that she was pondering something. I didn’t have to ask what she was thinking. I knew she would tell me shortly.

“I wonder if, when they had accidents, if they discovered they liked it? Liked the way it made them feel. The warm pee. The wetness. The exhilaration from just letting go. Doing something that adults shouldn’t do . . . at least to the extent that society dictates. You know: ‘you’re not supposed to have accidents in your pants,’” she said in a mocking tone.

“Taboo,” I said.

Tara looked at me with a grin. I know we were both thinking about her peeing her pants the week before. Her question about other peeing having accidents, peeing their pants, solidified that.

“Hey,” Tara said. “You remember Abby? The one with the amazing ass? She was on the dance squad, so she was in great shape.

I nodded. Abby did have a nice ass, but not nearly as nice as the one parked next to me. I really liked where this conversation was going. I was starting to get aroused. Tara turned toward me, now straddling the bench. She proceeded to tell me about a particular evening she and Abby had gone out drinking. Neither had gotten shit-faced drunk, but they were feeling good. The bar they were leaving was within walking distance from Abby’s apartment. In their slightly inebriated state, they were headed back to Abby’s on foot. Abby had made a comment that she should have peed before they left the bar, but the bathrooms at the bar were atrocious. Abby’s urge to pee had gotten worse, because Abby had to stop walking a few times to get a handle on her bladder.

“We’d made it three blocks from the bar, and we still had about three blocks to go,” Tara said. “I could tell she was in trouble.”

They’d made it another block, and Abby stopped abruptly. She hadn’t made any comments about not being able to hold it any more or that she was in danger of peeing her pants. Tara said Abby just offered an uncomfortable grimace.

“Abby just let her bladder go in her pants,” Tara said, smiling. “Right there. No explanation. No apologies. No tears of embarrassment.

I raised my eyebrows and smiled. Intriguing story and more arousal on my side of the bench.

“Oh,” she said. “It gets better. Hang on.”

Tara put her hand on my thigh.

After fully wetting her pants, Abby had just looked down at her wet pants, smirked, and kept walking. She looked slightly uncomfortable, as one might after having just pissed their pants. But, according to Tara, Abby just soldiered on, acting as if she were slightly inconvenienced by the event. Abby had been wearing gray yoga tights and a sweatshirt. Tara said it was more than obvious that she’d peed in her pants, but they’d kept walking. It was not a bar night. It was a Tuesday. Bar nights, at least in this town, were on Wednesdays and Saturdays. They’d passed not a soul as they continued their walk back to Abby’s.

“Her ass looked amazing in those pants,” Tara said. “Looked even better after she’d wet her pants.”

“I know the feeling,” I replied.

Tara’s grin widened, and she squeezed my thigh.

As they continued their trek back to the apartment, Tara had noticed Abby clutching her stomach. They were within sight of Abby’s apartment complex, and Tara began hearing Abby’s stomach bubbling and churning. Something was brewing. They had stopped to grab something to eat before they’d gone out drinking, and Tara surmised something wasn’t settling well in her friend’s stomach. As Abby’s stomach began announcing more distress, Abby explained to Tara in staccato breaths that they needed to hurry and get back to the apartment - ‘I’ve seriously got to poop. Jesus!’

The two walked at a more brisk pace. Every step was increasingly difficult for Abby. Abby kept repeating, ‘we’re almost there. Come one. Bathroom.’

“We made it up the stairs of her second-story apartment,” Tara said. “Abby had her keys out and was fiddling with them, trying to find the one to unlock the door. I could tell she was about ready to lose it.”

Tara leans closer to me on the bench, nodding slowly. I leaned in closer to Tara.

“Abby suddenly freezes and drops her keys,” Tara continued. “She clutched her stomach with one hand and her ass with the other. Oh my God! I heard Abby groan and gasp and a series of wet farts. All hell broke loose in her pants. Just squelching, pops, and plops.”

My eyes widened.

“Abby just stood in front of her apartment door and noisily pooped in her pants,” Tara said, almost whispering. “I mean she was just filling her pants right there. The back of her pants turned into a sloppy mess, and there was more coming. The butt of her yoga tights started to sag. Like the size of a grapefruit was already in there.”

“Jesus! What’d you do? I mean . . . “

“Wasn’t much I could do, really,” Tara said, shrugging. “I reached down and grabbed Abby’s keys, unlocked the door, and tried to figure out how to help Abby into her apartment.”

Abby was still moaning, groaning, and grunting with every shuffle step through the door.

“I didn’t want the neighbors on her floor to see what was happening, so I stepped behind Abby and put my hand on her back to help guide her and hopefully speed up the process of getting her out of sight,” she said. “I finally got her in, closed the door behind us, and I quickly hung up her keys on the hook next to the door. I heard Abby inhale sharply, and then she pushed one more time. Probably just wanting to get the rest out of her, regardless if it was in her pants or not.”

Tara’s description of Abby’s final push was perfect:

“It was super wet. Made a loud splat! The back of her already messy pants looked like the grapefruit exploded and spread across her ass. I actually watched some of it creep down the legs of her pants. It just kind of glopped down her legs like little slugs.”

Tara’s description of Abby’s mess aroused me further. Being this close on the bench, Tara noticed and smiled. She leaned closer. I felt her sweet breath on my face. I was almost breathless with excitement, but I managed my own summary of Tara’s story:

“So, Abby pees her pants on the walk home, keeps walking, her stomach is in agony. You two make it to her apartment door, and -

“Abby poops her pants,” Tara finishes. “Just fill her pants with a vengeance.”

I lean forward and kiss Tara’s lips hungrily. She leans into me just as hungrily. I didn’t want to, but I broke the kiss. I felt more breathless with excitement.

“What happened next?” I whispered.

Tara nuzzled into my neck, her hand sliding up my thigh to the raging erection beneath my jeans. She whispered in my ear.

“I helped get her cleaned up, showered with her,” she said, nibbling on my ear. “We got dried off, didn’t put on any clothes. We got down on the bathroom floor, and I ate her pussy hard. She came, and it sprayed all warm and wet all over my face.”

I moaned.

“Jesus,” I said, pulling Tara closer. “You’re going to make me cum in my pants.”

“My panties are feeling really warm and sticky already, baby,” she replied. “But, you’re right. We’re in public. Let’s get out of here.”

As much as I didn’t want to stop, I nodded. We stood and started toward the car.

“Whew,” Tara said as we walked. “Drank too much tea, and that sandwich I ate isn’t making my tummy happy.”

I raised an eyebrow at her.

“If I’m not careful, I’m going to put myself in an Abby situation.”

It can’t be understated that, after Tara’s story about Abby, I wanted exactly that to happen. We concocted a plan: a quick shopping trip for a change of clothes for both of us and a hotel room. Tara said she could hold it until we got to the hotel room.

“But, I’m not sure it’ll be much longer than that.”

She gave my ass a playful slap.
