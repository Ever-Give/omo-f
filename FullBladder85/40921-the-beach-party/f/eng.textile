Hey everyone, I'm back again with another long story about some people who are extremely desperate to pee. I met to post this here when I finished it a few months ago, but I realized recently that I completely forgot to until now, so my apologize for the delay.

Note: This story is long and divided up into multiple parts, so that it's easier to read in more than one sitting. Each part averages about 5,000 words in length, except for part #5, the final part, which is twice as long. So yeah, it'll take a while to read through it all.

The Beach Party, Part #1

"Hey Zora, you'll love this party I just heard about".

"Oh? Why is that Matt? You know I only like parties if there's plenty of beer involved"

"Oh there is, take a look at this flyer William gave me" replied Matt, handing it to Zora.

Zora looked at the flyer, it was advertising a weekend party at the beach for the entire freshmen class, and promising plenty of beer. The group would leave extra early on a bus at 6 AM on a Saturday, and head home on a bus on Sunday at 7 PM. It also vaguely promised some 'beer contests' that people could win money participating in, or placing bets on. In smaller font it was stated that most of the beer served before the evening would be non-alcoholic for legal liability reasons.

"Well I'm sure they'd love for two gorgeous people like us to be there Matt. Too bad we're both too broke to bet any money on the contests it advertises" said Zora.

"Hey don't say that before we even know what the contests are" argued Matt. "We both know how you're able to drink a lot of big tough guys under the table Zora, including yours truly. No one ever expects the slim sexy nerd girl to be able to down more beer then them".

Matt's flattering description of Zora described her well. Zora was a slim and sexy 19 year old college girl with long dark hair who majored in mathematics. Despite how Zora looked like a lightweight, whenever she went out drinking with the guys she always drank more beer than even the tall muscular jocks in the group. Zora was also well known among her friends for having an iron bladder, since she never visited the ladies room when she went out drinking. Not even when the others in her group had each visited the restrooms several times in the night while drinking less beer than her. Zora never took more than 3 trips to the toilet in a day, and could often easily get away with just 2 pees a day without too much trouble.

Despite being one of the smartest students in her year, Zora often hung out with the guys who could be described as the 'dumb jocks' who were great at sports and had great bodies but weren't the brightest bulbs. Her boyfriend Matt was one of those guys, big and muscular but not the brightest at academic work.

"Just because I'm good at it doesn't mean that I'll win any bets we place on me" protested Zora, "but even if we're too broke to bet money we could still win some of the prizes it talks about".

"Then I'll find a few bucks to place a bet on you if it's a drinking contest Zora" said Matt. "But first lets answer the million dollar question. Are we going to sign up for this party or what"?

"Of course we are" Zora replied eagerly. "William may be known as a rich prick, but he's also known to always throw the best parties. Just make sure you tell Steve and Phil about this, they'll want to go to". Steve and Phil were friends of Zora and Matt who they often hung out with and went out drinking with.

"Way ahead of you Zora, I ran into them first and already told them while I was looking for you" grinned Matt. "I'll go RSVP for us both".

When the day of the party came Zora was as exhausted as everyone else from having to get up before 6 AM to catch the bus. Zora woke up so close to 6 AM that she barely had time to get dressed and visit the bathroom to take a morning piss before racing to catch the bus. As they got onto the buses Zora counted roughly 100 college students coming along for the weekend beach party.

Zora had dressed appropriately in skimpy clothing since it was bound to be quite warm at the beach, and she wanted to show off her sexy body. Zora wore a skimpy black bikini underneath a skimpy tank top and a very short jeans denim skirt. Zora saw that most of the other girls had dressed similarly. Most of the guys were in just their swim trunks and a short sleeve shirt. Since they wouldn't arrive at the beach for several hours, and it was so early in the day, Zora, Matt, and almost all the other passengers quickly fell asleep during the long ride.

"Zora wake up, we're at the beach" whispered Matt.

"Huh" yawned Zora as she opened her eyes and looked around. It looked like Matt was right, almost everyone else was already getting out of their seats and helping to carry beach supplies and coolers of refreshments out. Zora looked out the window, and saw the beautiful ocean splashing onto the beach sand.

As they got off the bus Zora saw that the beach they had gone to was truly as in the middle of nowhere as possible. It was a very rural looking place with a lot of grass and mountains in the distance inland, and no signs of civilization for miles. William had promised that they'd have absolute privacy on the beach where no one would disturb them, and the location he had picked certainly seemed to deliver on that promise.

Soon the beach supplies and drinks were completely unloaded from the buses and the buses drove away. Zora, Matt, and most of the others stripped down to their bikini's and swim trunks and began to put on sunscreen. Matt finished putting the sunscreen on himself first.

"Hey, I'll be back in a bit Zora, I gotta go take a piss" said Matt as he began to get up.

"Go right ahead" replied Zora, though she wondered where Matt intended to go. Zora had already gotten enough of a look at the beach & nearby area to see that there were no public restrooms here. There weren't even any buildings in sight for miles. There was also barely anything to hide behind to offer any privacy.

As Matt began to walk away the direction he was heading in immediately answered Zora's question. He was heading towards some several feet high sand dunes that stretched pretty far. At least 4 other guys were already standing near the sand dunes facing away from Zora and most of the other college students. It didn't take a genius to figure out even from the distance that they were all peeing on the sand dunes.

"Hey Matt" Zora shouted while he was still within earshot, "get me a cold bottle of beer on your way back, I'm thirsty". Zora heard Matt shout an 'ok' back to her.

As Zora was left alone to put her sunscreen on her mind turned to the obvious question, what would Zora do when she had to pee later. While Zora had no urge to go right now, having just taken a morning piss about 3 hours ago, she had little doubt that she'd be needing to go eventually with all the beer she'd be drinking today. Zora had figured that there would be a public restroom nearby that she could use, but obviously that wasn't the case.

While Zora wasn't completely opposed to the idea of squatting down to pee somewhere outdoors if she had no other choice, the thought of peeing without any privacy really bothered her. Zora didn't want over 100 other college students to see her squatting down for a piss. The sand dunes didn't really offer much of any privacy even if she went behind them, they were just too short. The thought of wading into the ocean and peeing through her bikini bottom crossed Zora's mind. But Zora couldn't stomach the thought of purposely peeing in the ocean. It was disgusting to even think about, let alone to actually do it.

'I guess I can hold it until it's pitch dark. Then I can take a short walk somewhere away from the others, and pee in the privacy of the cover of darkness' Zora pondered in her head. Without doing any math, Zora thought holding it that long might be a bit of a stretch for her iron bladder. If she wanted to Zora could easily pee just twice a day, once in the morning after just getting up, and once before bed. But that was without drinking a lot of beer throughout the day, and Zora had intended on drinking a lot of beer today. 'I should probably be alright, just as long as I make a conscious effort not to drink too much beer throughout the day' Zora thought. Zora tried to do some math in her head to determine how much beer she could get away with drinking without getting too uncomfortable before nightfall.

Zora's thoughts were interrupted by Matt returning to her, carrying 2 bottles of beer in his hand, each were 12 ounces in size, the size of a can of soda. "Here, this bottle of beer is ice cold just the way you like it" said Matt as he handed Zora one. A thirsty Zora eagerly took the bottle from Matt and took a deep sip.

Zora and Matt soon hooked up with their friends Steve and Phil, and some other college students as they began to have fun partying on the beach for the next hour. Zora ended up playing a game of volleyball with Matt against Steve and Phil. At one point during their game the guys called for a couple minute break to fetch and drink another bottle of beer. If it weren't for the lack of a restroom at the beach Zora would have grabbed herself a second bottle of beer without a second thought, instead Zora made an effort to restrain herself. 'Wait an hour before you grab a second beer, two in an hour is one too many this early in the day' Zora kept telling herself in her head.

As the first hour wore on, Zora got to see a lot of other guys making use of the sand dunes to pee, and even some girls to. The lack of privacy the girls and guys had who went behind the sand dunes to pee only reinforced Zora's commitment to wait until it was pitch dark out to pee. That time was still many hours away however, it wasn't even 10 AM yet, though Zora still had no urge to go as of yet.

Towards the end of their first hour at the beach as the clock neared 10 AM, William began to shout to get people's attention.

"Alright everyone gather around and shut up for a moment, I've got an announcement to make" yelled William. Zora and her friends followed the crowd towards William. Soon there was a crowd of roughly 100 college students standing around William.

"Alright everyone, you all no doubt noticed on the flyers I passed out advertising this party that it promised beer contests, and betting you can place on it" William announced. The crowd nodded eagerly. "Well, the first of those contests is to begin soon at roughly 10 AM".

"What will the contest be" asked someone in the crowd.

"Glad someone asked" said William, "has everyone ever heard of Edward Fortyhands contests, also called Amy Winehands contests in some places". Some people in the crowd shouted yes, but others said no. Zora was among the no's.

"You've gotta be kidding me that you've never heard of it" Matt whispered in Zora's ears.

"What" whispered Zora defensively, "I'm good at drinking lots of beer, but I've never entered any drinking contests before. Unless you count drinking you under the table for fun a contest".

"Well for those who don't know it's simple" shouted William, continuing to talk over the whisperings from the crowd. William turned around and opened a large cooler behind him. He pulled out a large 40 ounce (1,183 ml) bottle of beer and held it up high for everyone to see. "The people in the contest get one of these 40 ounce bottles duct taped to each of their hands, that's 80 ounces of beer total. They can't use their hands for anything except for drinking from the beer bottles duct taped to them. Only by completely draining both bottles can they remove the duct tape and be free to use their hands for other things again".

"See" whispered Matt, "we've already done it before with Steve and Phil, just without the duct tape". Zora nodded back, they had indeed had several similar contests in their dorm rooms in the past. Despite her smaller size Zora had always finished her bottles first in those contests.

"What if you have to go to the bathroom from all that drinking" a girl in the crowd asked.

William grinned obnoxiously as he answered "then you better finish your beer fast so you can go. Or you can always go in your bikini or swim trunks in front of the crowd". Some people in the crowd laughed. "But if you want to win some cash prizes you better hold it till you finish. The first person to finish their bottles wins $100, and there's prizes for 2nd and 3rd place to. And you can all place bets on who you think will win, and who you think will wet themselves instead of finishing".

"If you want in the first contest then come see me" William concluded, "I'd like at least 8 people, but more is fine to. And remember it's still morning so it's non-alcoholic beer we'll be drinking".

As the crowd broke up when William finished talking Zora's friends wasted no time encouraging her to enter the Edwards Fortyhands contest. As a bunch of poor college students with little extra spending money, the dollar signs were already in the eyes of her friends. William's contest and betting sounded like a golden opportunity for Zora and her friends to make some money.

"Zora you've gotta enter that contest, you'll win for sure" her boyfriend Matt told her.

"That contest is a free $100 for the taking for you Zora, and a free can't lose bet for the three of us" said Steve. "I don't know about the rest of you, but I have just $20, so I'd love to double that amount".

Seeing the look of indecisiveness on her face, Phil chimed in "and since we wouldn't be able to win that free money without you we can even give you a cut of it to Zora. How about say 15 percent?". Matt and Steve both nodded in agreement with Phil.

"Alright, alright I'll do it boys" said Zora as she bowed to peer pressure from her friends, and the lure of some much needed cash.

In truth Zora hadn't hesitated just because she wasn't as confident in winning as her friends were. She was also concerned about how much beer she'd have to drink and how it would undoubtedly hit her bladder sooner or later long before night fell. Some quick math told Zora that downing two 40 ounce bottles of beer would fill her bladder more than 6 of the smaller 12 ounce (355 ML) bottles Zora had already drank one of. And this contest was all about downing a bunch of beer all at once, not over the course of several hours.

And yet Zora was also flat broke just like her friends, so she told herself she could cope with two large bottles of beer. Having just one smaller bottle of beer an hour was being too overly cautious anyway Zora told herself. What good was an iron bladder if Zora didn't put it to use? Besides, it was only one contest, it wasn't like she'd have to do it again, or that they'd let her enter again after she won the first time.

"Are you sure Zora, you seemed a bit indecisive" asked Matt, picking up on Zora's concern, but not realizing the reason for the concern.

"Yes I'm sure Matt, I'm sure guys" said Zora, more confidently then before. "I'm as broke and in need of the extra spending money as you all are. I'll go see William to sign up right now".

"And we'll all go and place bets on your certain victory" Steve added joyfully.

William showed how his reputation as a rich prick was well earned when Zora approached him and announced she wanted to be in his Edward Fortyhands contest. "You?" William laughed, "are you here to try to win it, or are you just here to get some free beer".

Zora wasn't surprised by William's skepticism. As a slim woman who was only 5 feet 5 inches tall, average height for a woman, Zora hardly looked like a person who could down a lot of beer faster than much bigger guys. Zora's three muscle man friends Matt, Steve, and Phil had all once underestimated her the same way when they had first met. Zora took great pleasure in proving to others that they had underestimated her prowess at drinking beer.

"Of course I'm here win your contest" Zora replied with fierce determination. "I've drank plenty of big tough looking guys under the table before, including those three".

William laughed at Zora's determination, clearly skeptical of her claims. "Well if you insist then sure, you can be contestant number 7, which is probably where you'll place to, 7th". Zora only smiled at William's arrogance, if others underestimated her like him then her friends could probably do better than just doubling their money on her win.

"Don't underestimate my girlfriend man" said Matt. "I'm so confident in her that I'm placing a bet on her finishing in 1st place". Matt waved a $20 bill in his hand to show he was serious.

"Well if you want to blow $20 on loyalty to your girl then be my guess" laughed William. "As for you Zora, go sit on the orange beach chair over there with the number 7 written on it, so that the others will know you're in the contest. Wait with the other contestants for the game to begin".

There ended up being a total of nine people in the Edwards Fortyhand contest by the time it started at 10 AM. Besides Zora, there were two other girls in the contest, one of them was Kelly, she was a short, slim, and sexy girl like Zora, though she was a few inches shorter than Zora. Zora was sure William had mocked her as well when she wanted to enter the contest. Zora was sure that the girl was much better at rapidly downing beers then she looked, she had an aura of confidence about her.

One of the other six guys, named Russell, was a strong jock who was over six and a half feet tall. Not surprisingly many were placing their bets on him to win first place. 'The bigger they are the harder they'll fall' Zora thought to herself as she smiled at him.

When the contest was about to begin everyone formed a large circle around William, Zora, and the rest of the contestants. They watched as William duct taped two large 40 ounce bottles of beer to the hands of Zora and the other contestants. Zora smiled as William duct taped the beers to her hand, the bottles were both quite cold, just the way Zora liked her beer.

"Alright everyone, when I say go you can all start drinking and the contest will be on" said William. "Is everyone here ready to drink"! There was a pause as Zora and the others all shouted yes excitedly. "Alright then, get ready, and GO, DRINK!".

Zora didn't even pay attention to what the others were doing when the contest started. She knew from past experience going up against Matt, Steve, and Phil in similar contests that the way for her to win was to pace herself. Trying to down a third of the bottle in one gulp never worked out well for the guys. While the beer wasn't alcoholic like it had been when Zora had done this before, Zora didn't adjust her strategy.

Zora only took herself out of the zone to see how the others were doing briefly when she finished completely draining the first 40 ounce bottle. None of the others had finished their first beer bottle yet. Many of Zora's competitors weren't even halfway done their first bottle. Two people were fairly close on Zora's heels however, Russell the six and a half foot giant, and Kelly the slim girl who was several inches shorter then Zora. Others in the crowd were obviously dumbfounded by how the two slim and good looking girls were giving the giant athlete Russell a run for his money. There was a lot of taunting from the crowd aimed at Russell and the other guys.

"You're doing great Zora, keep going!" Zora heard Matt and her friends shouting.

Zora went back into the zone, and kept on drinking from her second bottle at a steady pace, blind to what her competitors were doing.

When Zora drained the last of her second 40 ounce bottle of beer she knew without even looking at the other contestants that she had won. She heard her friends Matt, Steve, and Phil giving the loudest cheers of the group. Zora looked to her side and saw a surprised William walking over to her. William grabbed Zora's hands and raised the beer bottles to his eye level to verify they were both indeed empty, and then raised Zora's right hand into the air.

"The unexpected 1st place winner everyone, contestant #7, Zora" announced William to the cheering crowd. William soon removed the duct tape and beer bottles from Zora's hands, and then shook her hand. "Congratulations Zora, I never thought someone of your size could down that much beer in just 21 minutes. Feel free to run off for a pee now, I'm sure you need it after all that beer".

William's mention of a pee was an unwelcome reminder of Zora's predicament, and how she had just made things harder on herself by downing so much beer so early in the day. Zora already felt the first twinges of an urge to pee hitting her bladder. Most of the beer hadn't had time to get to Zora's iron bladder just yet however, so Zora simply told William "thanks, but I'm good, I don't need a leak just yet".

"Well feel free to run off to take a leak whenever all that beer hits your bladder" amended William, before he returned his attention to Russell and Kelly. Zora glanced at them as well, and saw Kelly had passed Russell, though Kelly also seemed to be feeling the effects of the beer, with how she was fidgeting her legs around.

When Kelly finished 4 minutes after Zora, she didn't waste any time getting William to take the beer bottles off. "Hurry it up William, I've gotta pee really bad, I should have gone before the contest started". When William removed the duct tape and bottles from her hands, Kelly immediately gripped her crotch with both hands and ran off towards the sand dunes. Zora noted that a lot of people kept taking glances in the direction of Kelly and the sand dunes while Kelly was gone, which only reaffirmed to Zora that there would be no privacy to her if she peed on the sand dunes.

The next 35 minutes everyone else in the contest who finished also ran off to the sand dunes for a much needed piss. However 2 of the contestants, one guy and one girl, both couldn't hold it before finishing their beer. The guy just stood there blushing as he soaked his swim trunks with urine and had it run down his legs. The girl, though unable to use her hands to try to keep her legs dry, tried squatting down on the ground when it started to run down her legs. It helped stop her legs from getting much wetter at least, but that was about all it accomplished.

Just watching the two college students lose control of their bladder was enough to send thoughts of Zora's own bladder back to the top of her mind. Zora felt shivers run down her spine and into her filling bladder as she wondered if she'd be able to hold on till nightfall.

By 11 AM when the contest was over Zora felt the beer continuing to rapidly pump itself into her bladder. But Zora tried to ignore her bladder by focusing on the money she and her friends had just won.

"So exactly how much did you boys bet on me" asked Zora as Matt, Steve, and Phil returned with their winnings in hand.

"Together we bet $80" answered Matt, "But so many people bet against you and on the other 8 contestants that William gave you 3 to 1 odds".

As the math whiz in the group Zora knew how slim the odds were considered for a 3 to 1 chance event to occur, and what the payout was for 3 to 1 odds. Zora's jaw dropped in shock as she realized how much money that had netted the guys.

"You guys raked in $240 dollars in profit!" Zora practically screamed in delight.

"How well did you expect us to do" asked Steve.

"I was expecting you three to collectively make around $100 in profits total, even if you bet all the cash you were carrying" answered Zora. "If I had known you three would make that much I wouldn't have even hesitated to enter the contest".

"So, what's 15% of $240 dollars Zora" asked Matt. "Since we all agreed beforehand that would be your cut for entering the contest and winning us the money".

Zora did the quick mental math "that's $36 dollars, let's hope we have enough smaller bills"

Zora and the three guys sat down on their beach blanket and counted the money together. The gambling money totaled $320. Matt, Steve, and Phil each pocketed the $80 they originally bet, and handed Zora $36 dollars, then split up the remaining $204 among themselves. Zora found herself catching the guy's contagious greed for easy money as they counted it out. It had been so easy winning the contest, and Zora couldn't remember ever seeing so much cash in real life before.

"It's a shame that they surely won't let me play in the remaining drinking contests now" said Zora as she pocketed her money. "It surely wouldn't pay out as much as this one did now, but hey free money is free money".

"You never know if you don't ask" piped up Phil as he started to get up, "I'll go ask William if you'll be allowed to enter the next one, and when it'll be".

"If you can enter it again, imagine how much more money we could win by betting more than $80" said Matt, as thoughts of what to do with their unexpected spending money filled their minds.

Zora's thoughts of how to spend her money were interrupted by Phil returning with a big grin on his face. "Hey guys, William said why not, people love seeing if winners can win again against fiercer competition. Also he said the next contest will be at 2 PM, which is in another 3 hours".

While Zora acted happy with her friends at the news, in the back of Zora's mind there was only one thing she was thinking.

'CRAP CRAP CRAP!' Zora screamed in her head as thoughts of her rapidly filling bladder refused to be ignored any longer. 'What have I just gotten myself into? I can't back out now after just telling the guys I'd do another contest'. Zora glanced at the $136 dollars in her wallet. 'Plus the money is too good for all of us for me to back out, I wish we weren't so poor'. Zora wondered how she'd ever hold on till nightfall if she had another 80 ounces of beer so early in the afternoon.

Oblivious to Zora's anxiety, Matt wrapped his arms around Zora from behind and pulled her closer for a kiss. "Who says we have to do just one more contest guys? I think my girl can go on a long winning streak in these contests".

Matt didn't even give Zora a chance to reply as he bent down and kissed her on the lips. But she could see how Steve and Phil's eyes lit up at Matt's idea, and knew immediately that Matt's big mouth had just made her desperate plight even worse. Out loud Zora simply told them "we'll see when we get there boys".
