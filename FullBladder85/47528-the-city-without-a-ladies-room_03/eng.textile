You would think that the women in this city would:

A) Reduce their fluid intake to an absolute bare minimum

And/or

B) Avoid any food or beverage containing caffeine.

Good story, by the way.

Dehydration is way more dangerous than wetting though

Good points, both are things I had in mind addressing eventually, but I don't know if Erin & Jeff's situation is really the right one for it.

I also want to do a story like this(with no ladies room city) if OP doesn't mind!

Sure, go right ahead.

You mean you already finished it? I'd be interested in reading it.

You could always get a native English speaker in the community to proof read it for you before you publish it.

That said on the subject of the next chapter of The City Without a Ladies Room, normally I post these as a status update in my profile, but since this thread is still getting posts: It's not yet ready unfortunately. I'm presently over 2,000 words into it. Not far enough along to publish anything or give an ETA as of yet, but I'm very pleased with my progress today, I got a lot done.

It's possible I might split the next chapter into two shorter chapters (which would mean posting the next part sooner). I've been aiming for no more then 6 page chapters, and right now I'm worried this chapter will easily go over 8 pages.
