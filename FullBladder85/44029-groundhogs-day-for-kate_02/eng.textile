Is part 3 still happening?

I know, I'm very slow, I'm sorry. Life has been getting in my way a lot lately.

I'm really close to finishing up the other story I was working on, then my full writing attention will be on this story. I definitely want to continue this story. I only have 1 page of the next chapter so far, but I definitely like it way better then what I had previously.
