The Beach Party, Part #4

Back at the campfire, Kelly couldn't help but smirk as she kept replaying in her mind how Zora had hobbled away from the campfire with Matt. Her rival had looked so pathetic and close to bursting with both hands jammed into her crotch, even her boyfriend had clearly noticed. 'It shouldn't be long now' Kelly thought to herself, eager to see her rival lose to her superior bladder.

Kelly was surprised then when Zora returned to the campfire with a calm and confident walk, rather than the pathetic hobbling she had left it doing. At first glance Kelly thought from Zora's body language that Zora had already given up and pissed in the sand dunes. But then she noticed the still large bladder bulge Zora was sporting, which clearly hadn't shrunk from even a partial pee. "How about having a drink with me" Zora asked Kelly with a smile.

Kelly bristled in annoyance for a fraction of a second before stopping herself, and putting a feigned grin on her face. "If you want to make a mistake and have one too many beers than you can handle then sure, I'll have one with you" she replied.

"In your dreams, a beer queen's bladder can handle her beer" Zora replied as the women each got up and helped themselves to a 12 ounce can of alcoholic beer. As if taunting her, Zora added in a whisper that only she and Kelly could hear. "A beer queen doesn't ever have to piss in the sand dunes in broad daylight either Kelly, she should be above such an unladylike thing".

Kelly pretended not to hear Zora's taunt, but the wheels were already beginning to spin in her mind because of it. 'I can read between the lines Zora. You don't like peeing outdoors during the day. You'll soon regret revealing that to me' Kelly thought to herself.

By 9 PM Zora and Kelly found themselves seated around one of the large campfires with 10 other people. Both women had finished their 12 ounce bottle of alcoholic beer a half an hour ago. Zora was already feeling its effects on her bursting bladder, which was feeling even more desperate then before after 15 hours without a piss. But following Matt's advice, she tried to look unaffected by it. Zora tried to tell herself she was unaffected by the extra beer. She tried to tell herself she was merely imagining that her bladder's urgent need to piss had gotten more urgent since her last beer.

Kelly, who was sitting next to Zora, was also trying to look unaffected by the beer as well, but with a bit less success as she kept shaking one of her crossed legs around. By contrast, Zora's crossed legs remained relatively still. Zora and Kelly's eyes briefly met as they glanced at each other. Kelly found herself getting a bit unnerved when she saw so much confidence in her rival's eyes, rather than the constant worry and doubt she had seen earlier. Worse yet, Zora smiled at her and whispered low enough for only Kelly to hear "I hope you're not too bothered by all that beer we've had today Kelly".

"Of course not!" Kelly pouted back in a whisper as she tried to control her temper. In truth Kelly's own bladder was bothering her quite a lot after 10 and a half hours without relief. Normally Kelly would have enjoyed being this full, and how the fullness often pressed down on her G-spot and helped make her horny. But today it only angered her that her bladder was this desperately full already while her unexpected rival was still holding it in, and seemed unconcerned about holding it even longer. Where had this newfound strength and confidence in her rival come from if she truly hadn't peed in 15 hours?

Kelly had long considered herself the beer queen and the bladder queen, and yet this long dark haired beauty she never met before had already put her beer drinking prowess to shame twice. Kelly couldn't allow Zora to do the same to her iron bladder. The memory of those losses still boiled her blood, and her tie in the last contest had done little to cool her simmering anger.

Kelly had blamed her loss in the first contest on her own cockiness, since she had freely downed several beers before the contest while Zora hadn't. But her second loss couldn't be excused away on lack of preparations, the second loss had enraged her even more. It had seemed like such a perfect plan to show off her prowess at beer drinking. Drinking a bunch of big tough college guys under the table would have grabbed her all the attention, but Zora had stolen the show from her and ruined it.

In Kelly's mind only the sight of Zora pissing herself in front of everyone when her bladder finally gave out could make up for the wound to her pride losing the beer drinking contests had caused.

The problem with Kelly's revenge fantasy was obvious however. Kelly was certain Zora would never pee outdoors during the day or early evening. Hence Zora would no doubt be very tempted to take a much needed before bed piss somewhere under the cover of total darkness, regardless of their unofficial holding contest they were having.

It would be Zora's one and only chance to piss at the beach. If Zora didn't take it she'd have to continue to try to hold it all day tomorrow until they were back at the college. So how could Kelly prevent Zora from taking a much needed piss before bed and during the night? Kelly sat in silence next to Zora, brooding over how she could make her revenge fantasy a reality.

After a while Kelly decided she needed to get away from Zora and her calm demeanor. Kelly stood up, careful not to squirm around obviously in desperation. Once standing she left Zora and the others behind, and walked towards the opposite end of the beach.

After a few minutes she was pleased to hear the familiar voice of William. "You look like you're letting your drinking and iron bladder rival get your mood down too much" he said. "You're usually in a much better mood this late into the day Kelly". Kelly continued to glare at William in the dark with a ticked off expression on her face. "Doesn't the thought of full bladder sex on the beach with your boyfriend excite you anymore Kelly" William asked in a mock wounded lover voice.

"Sorry Will, nothing can distract me from my scorn for that woman for humiliating me by beating me twice at the beer contests" Kelly replied angrily. "I won't let her best me at having an iron bladder to, even if it means holding it all night and well into the next day".

Sensing what was occupying her mind William asked "but will your rival Zora hold it all night with you just to settle this question? Or will she give up and finally pee on the sand dunes tonight before falling asleep?".

"That's my concern to William" Kelly replied. "I don't just want to beat her, I want to humiliate her. I want to see her piss herself in front of everyone. I don't want her to sneak off by herself for a piss tonight after most of the others are asleep for the night".

William was silent for several minutes, pondering over what Kelly had told him. Knowing no one but William could see her clearly in the dark, Kelly fidgeted around openly in desperation and gripped her crotch freely, in part from her bladder, and in part for William's pleasure. After several minutes William got a big grin on his face and kissed Kelly on the lips.

"What?" she asked, "what's the big grin for?".

"Leave your problem to me Kelly" William said. " I'll make sure that Zora's desperate bladder won't be getting any relief tonight, so that you can fulfill your revenge fantasy tomorrow".

Kelly wanted to ask William how he would accomplish this, but she knew from past experience he would never tell her until after he did it. She just had to hope that he would come through.

Another hour passed and 10 PM finally arrived, and with it the 4th drinking contest. It also met that Zora and Kelly had won the holding contest bets from earlier, which netted Zora another $92, and Matt, Steve, and Phil a net gain of $181. Because of the late hour there would only be betting on who would win the 10 PM beer drinking contest, which would be held with alcoholic beer this time. Zora figured the guys would be betting a lot of their money on the contest, so she was determined to score a win instead of a tie this time.

Besides Zora and Kelly, William found 5 other guys and one larger girl who hadn't already gotten themselves drunk who were willing to enter the contest. Zora and Kelly were both as desperate as ever, but both tried to look perfectly calm as William duct taped two 40 ounce beer bottles to their hands. Both women tried to avoid fidgeting around to intimidate each other. Neither woman wanted to end the night losing the last drinking contest, especially not one with actual alcoholic beer.

When the drinking contest started Zora tried to ignore everything around her as she steadily worked on downing her 80 ounces of beer. In the back of her mind Zora feared how her already bursting bladder might revolt at the thought of downing another 80 ounces of beer. But following Matt's advice Zora told herself any increasingly urgent messages her bladder sent her was just her mind playing tricks on her.

While the drinking contest was going on, neither Zora or Kelly noticed when William and Matt both briefly disappeared from the crowd to have a heated whispered conversation.

"Are you serious man" Matt asked incredulously. "You want to bet how much against my girl?".

"You heard me right" William replied calmly. "$500, my girl Kelly against your girl Zora. First one who's girl spills even a drop of piss loses".

Matt could hardly believe his luck. Zora had asked him to keep an eye out for a chance to make money off of her holding contest against Kelly, and now such an opportunity had walked right into his face.

"I can take your bet" said Matt, "but only if my girl Zora wins this beer drinking contest, because otherwise I won't have $500 to bet on her".

William pretended to think it over for a moment, then nodded. "Don't let Kelly hear I agreed to our bet being official only if she lost a drinking contest".

Matt nodded his head in agreement. "You're on then, my girl can hold her piss in longer than yours can, she's my bladder queen".

"And Kelly is my perfect little bladder queen" William replied with a wicked smile as he and Matt shook on their agreement.

There was no way Zora would dare sneak off for a piss before bed with so much of her friend's money on the line. William was sure Kelly would be quite pleased with him when she found out. Now all Kelly had to do to fulfill her revenge fantasy was to beat Zora's iron bladder either tonight or tomorrow, and William was confident in his girl being able to do so.

Despite her vow to remain focused on her drinking to win the money, Zora found her attention drifting away from the contest as she finished her first 40 ounce bottle of beer. Her bladder's already urgent needs seemed to be growing more desperate as the alcohol hit her. Despite her vows to show no weakness Zora found herself starting to uselessly try to grip her throbbing pussy's pee hole with the hand that had the empty beer bottle duct taped to it. But of course with the beer bottle still there Zora didn't accomplish anything more than make herself look like a desperate little fool. Zora found herself starting to blush in embarrassment as she realized how silly her squirming must be making her look.

"Don't pee, don't pee" Zora found herself muttering repeatedly in her mind. "And don't squirm either, you promised Matt to stay strong".

Zora's drinking, and desperation was distracted suddenly by a loud hissing sound that Zora, even in her drunken state, recognized as someone pissing themselves. Fearing it was herself due to the alcohol weakening her iron bladder too much Zora glanced at her crotch, and saw she was still dry.

Zora glanced to the side at Kelly, and saw her still dry to, though clearly more desperate than before. Her and Kelly's eyes glanced over at the other contestants, and saw one of the guys in the contest was pissing himself. Much of the front of his swim trunks were soaked, and piss was running down one of his legs, but he was too drunk to care.

Zora almost let herself get glued to the sight, especially as piss began to run down the legs of the only other girl in the contest besides her and Kelly. But then Zora heard Matt's voice in the crowd shouting "keep drinking Zora, you can do this girl!", and she remembered what she was doing.

When Zora finally finished the last of her alcoholic beer she found her mood improved tenfold over what it had been before the alcohol. Her mood only got better when William informed her that she had won another close match against Kelly and removed the empty beer bottles from her hands. Kelly gave her an angry glare over being defeated yet again. But Zora, with her judgment impaired, just smiled back and waved, which only seemed to make Kelly madder.

Part of Zora knew that she ought to be worried when Matt told her about the $500 bet with William. After all she was already bursting for a piss, holding it for the rest of the night might be a stretch, let alone holding it into the morning and however long Kelly could last. But the alcohol was enough to drown out her concern and worry.

Instead, Zora's drunken response to Matt was to playfully whine in a slurred voice "But Matt, I really have to pee, like really bad Matt".

"But you won't pee now will you Zora" asked Matt, somewhat drunkenly. "We have big money on the line now for you resisting the urge to piss, because you're the bladder queen".

Hearing the title bladder queen brought back memories of Matt's earlier pep talk to Zora's drunk mind. She blushed, "I'm not a good queen Matt, I squirmed and potty danced a lot during that last contest. I really had to pee bad during that contest Matt, I still have to pee bad now". Zora blushed again as she realized she was hunched over gripping her crotch with both hands squirming in front of Matt.

Matt gently lifted Zora's arms away from her crotch and made her stand straight. "Just remember our pep talk from earlier babe" he whispered as he rubbed her shoulders. "You're a beer and a bladder queen Zora. Queens like you can always handle a little more beer, your mind is playing tricks on you if your bladder says otherwise. You're a lady, and like you told me, ladies can always wait just a little longer if they need to".

Zora felt her bladder's desperate urges relaxing a bit at Matt's calming words of encouragement. "I'm a bladder queen Matt" she smiled drunkenly. "I haven't peed in 16 and a half hours, I really have to pee bad now Matt. But I'm a queen, and queen's can hold it when they're expected to wait. William expects me to wait and hold it till we're back at the college, otherwise he would have brought us to a beach with a ladies room to use".

With confidence fueled somewhat by her hormones, and somewhat the alcohol, Zora gripped Matt's cock through his swim trunks, and found it fully erect. "That's why we ladies always have the longer bathroom lines while you boys get to go right in and pee" she whispered in an increasingly slurry voice. "You like it when we have to pee, you like making me hold it and get desperate for a pee from the beer, don't you? I should have recognized it sooner in you Matt".

Instead of answering, Matt drunkenly kissed Zora on the lips. "I always knew you were the brains Zora, figuring out stuff like that" he whispered drunkenly.

As 10:30 PM turned to midnight Matt, Steve, and Phil all had several more 12 ounce bottles of alcoholic beer. At first Zora refrained from joining them in their drinking, and simply sat by the dying fire fidgeting slightly in desperation. But after a while the alcohol's effect on her judgment and her own stubborn pride about out drinking the boys got the better of her, no matter what her bursting bladder said.

Steve and Phil looked surprised and a bit worried as they saw Zora help herself to a 12 ounce bottle of beer. Zora smiled drunkenly at them and said "I got thirsty, a beer queen can always have another beer can't she?". Zora noted the prideful look on Matt's face.

"Just don't drink more than you can handle with the money on the line" Steve reminded her.

"Don't be a buzz kill Steve, I wanna have a good time" Zora moaned, even while her bladder protested at the extra beer.

"Shouldn't you get Kelly to have a beer with you" Phil asked.

"I don't wanna drink with her, don't kill the party mood guys" Zora whined. "I don't have to make Kelly drink another beer to win the bet, because I'm a queen Phil". Zora gently rubbed her bladder bulge, visibly protruding by several inches. "Only a bladder queen can get one of these and still hold it Phil, a queen can hold it Phil". The logical part of Zora's mind would have agreed with Phil, but it was too snowed under by all the alcohol to stop Zora's drunken arrogance.

Around midnight William went around and extinguished all the campfires with buckets of ocean water to encourage everyone to go to bed. The others soon left the smothered out fire, but Zora and Matt remained, now alone. At Matt's suggestion they decided to use the darkness as an excuse to have one more beer before bed. By the time Zora and Matt finished their last beer at 12:15 AM, the night air had gotten pretty chilly, especially without the fire to warm them.

While Matt hadn't been in any of the beer contests, he had been packing away the beer tonight, having downed 6 beers in the last hour and a half. The beer, combined with the chilly air, were quickly making his bladder a problem. Matt found himself gripping his desperate cock through his swim trunks and squirming around in his seat.

Yet despite how drunk he was, Matt was still able to remember his fear from earlier when he placed his bet with William. Zora might try to take a midnight before bed pee if he left her alone now, in the near pitch darkness with no campfires to light things up anymore. Even drunk Matt knew he couldn't afford to lose $500 from Zora giving into such a temptation.

Matt's fears were well founded. The chilly air and added beer were also quickly making their effects known in Zora's bulging bladder. At first Zora tried to look tough for Matt and not squirm as she gently rubbed her legs together, but soon she couldn't keep her legs still as she uselessly tried adjusting them repeatedly for a bit of relief.

Zora found herself starting to wonder how good it would feel to drop her bikini bottom and piss in the smothered out campfire. Surely no one would see anything, and no one would ever suspect a thing Zora drunkenly thought. At first Zora's aversion for peeing anywhere but a toilet made her tell herself she shouldn't be thinking of such things. But soon her increasingly frantic desperation, and the alcohol's effects on lowering her inhibitions left her hoping Matt would leave her alone already so she could carry out her sneaky pee in private.

After several minutes of obvious squirming in her seat, and even gripping her crotch, Zora knew she couldn't take much more of this. She was on the verge of losing control of her iron bladder right there. If Matt wasn't going to leave then she had to do something her drunken mind told her. So she stood up carefully, as Matt, with his eyes glued to her, did the same.

"Leave me alone Matt, I have to pee before bed" Zora moaned in a slurry drunk voice. When Matt didn't move quick enough she added "I wanna pee in the campfire Matt, no one will ever know I did it".

Alarms went off in Matt's drunk mind at Zora's drunken confession. "You can't pee Zora, you need to keep holding it for our $500 bet".

"But I REALLY have to pee Matt, I haven't peed in over 18 hours" she whined. "Please just go Matt, I know you're desperate to pee on the sand dunes again, I see you squirming".

"You're not going to just let Kelly win like that are you" asked Matt, trying to ignore his own desperately full bladder. "Just because you're not enough of a lady to wait until morning. I thought you were a queen Zora".

"Like you're not gonna just go pee even if I agree to wait" complained Zora. "You boys peed on the sand dunes all day. Even Kelly peed on the sand dunes, and she's a girl. So why do I have to keep waiting while you all get to pee?".

"Because... I won't leave you alone to pee, even if it means I can't pee all night either" Matt replied.

For a long moment Zora and Matt were both silent as they stared drunkenly at each other and squirmed while gripping their crotch. Matt felt a lake of piss continuing to slosh around inside his bladder, and wondered how Zora had coped so well with the ocean of piss residing in her own much larger bladder. It was way harder then she made it look.

Finally a smile crept on Zora's face. "You're not keeping me from peeing tonight Matt" she whispered as she stepped within an inch of Matt's face. "I'm keeping you from peeing tonight, because you know you can't leave me alone to go pee in the sand dunes. And you're too much of a gentleman to pee in front of me when you know I really have to pee to. That would be too mean to me".

Speechless, Matt nodded, realizing Zora was right. On one hand he was glad that Zora wouldn't lose the bet by peeing before bed. On the other hand, he was disappointed that he couldn't take his own desperately needed piss. Zora however, was thrilled. "It's going to be fun watching you squirm with me for a change tonight Matt" she giggled as she kissed him. Soon she and Matt went to find some warm blankets to sleep under, and the couple with two desperately full bladders tried to fall asleep for the night.

Meanwhile, a half mile walk down the beach, Kelly and her bursting bladder were in absolute agony. Her heavy load of piss sloshed around her bursting bladder and hammered at her pee hole, desperate to come out.

Things only got worse for Kelly's tortured bladder as William thrust his hard cock into her tensed cunt. Kelly moaned loudly in both pleasure & pain, she loved riding the endless waves of pleasure their full bladder sex always gave her. If William had any doubts as to who the real bladder queen was on the beach, Kelly was determined to erase those doubts. The pressure Kelly felt with each thrust was immense, and sent constant jolts through her iron bladder. Kelly's bladder begged her to make William stop, but the rest of Kelly begged him to keep on going.

When Kelly and William both reached orgasm at the same time it felt like a bomb had gone off in Kelly's bladder. Kelly felt the ocean of piss sloshing inside of her bladder trying with explosive force to squeeze past her sphincter and run down her legs.

Kelly immediately jammed both hands into crotch to try to stem the flood as she moaned loudly in pleasure and agony. Kelly's years of training her mammoth iron bladder paid off as her sphincter muscles fought back against the overwhelming pressure, and she somehow miraculously didn't leak a drop.

For a minute Kelly rolled around in the sand in her own little world, gripping her crotch like mad and twisting her legs around, trying to calm her bladder down now that the sex was over.

Kelly's attempt to calm her bladder down was interrupted when she heard the familiar sound of someone urinating. The sound sent more urgent jolts through her bladder. For a horrified moment Kelly thought her iron bladder had failed her. But no, her hands and legs were still dry, she wasn't leaking, yet.

"William!" Kelly screamed with fury as she sat up, and saw his penis pissing a thick stream of urine into the sand a few feet in front of her. William was always doing cruel stuff like this around her when he knew she was so desperate to pee.

"What's the matter Kelly" asked William. "I thought you were a bladder queen who didn't mind when a guy pisses next to her. If you're not going to pee then surely you can wait without a problem".

Kelly nearly broke down and gave into the gallons of piss urgently sloshing around inside her bursting bladder. It was what Kelly did every other night she had full bladder sex with William, she rushed to the toilet for a much needed piss afterwards. Or if they were having sex outdoors like tonight, she'd squat down and piss a gusher where she was.

William's piss was like a drug to Kelly. She knew she should look away as William's piss continued to wreak havoc on her bladder and push her closer to leaking a massive spurt of piss down her legs. Just the sight of William's piss was tempting Kelly more by the second to give into her bladder's urgent demands and piss on the beach. And yet Kelly couldn't bring herself to look away from it, so she watched in a desperate jealous agony as William finished his piss.

"Do you want me to lose this damn $500 bet you made on me" Kelly hissed at William as he started to put his swim trunks back on. "Because this is how you make me lose a $500 bet".

"But you didn't Kelly" William replied in his calm and soothing voice. "You were able to hold it in anyway, because you're the real bladder queen on this beach". In truth, William came from a wealthy family, so $500 was nothing to him.

William smiled at Kelly's silence, knowing his charm had hit home. "Think of what you just went through as practice for tomorrow Kelly" he suggested. "Do you think your rival Zora could have survived what you just went through the last hour without springing at least a dozen leaks?".

Kelly soon put her bikini back on, and her and William walked the half mile back to the part of the beach the others were at. The walk back in the chilly night air was torture on Kelly's exhausted bladder. Nearly every step sent new jolts through her bursting bladder. So Kelly was very grateful when William fetched her some warm blankets to sleep under.

Despite Kelly's extreme desperation, she managed to fall asleep on the beach rather quickly. In the near pitch dark by now, Kelly and William didn't even notice that they had chosen to fall asleep right next to Zora and Matt, who were both already sound asleep despite their own bladder's urgent needs.

Zora and Kelly both needed their rest, for tomorrow the beer drinking contests would resume at 10 AM. Neither desperate woman knew how much more beer their bladder could take without relief. But both desperate women knew that they'd likely have to drink a lot more beer to defeat their iron bladdered rival to prove that they were the true bladder queen on the beach.
