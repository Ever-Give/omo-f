Something a little different here- I posted a couple of stories on Reddit's Writing Prompts. Admittedly, the first link is a topic I started myself then posted as a different user. The second link was an awesome pee theme submitted by another user, but unfortunately only I posted :( Would love to see some of this community writing over there too (and sharing interesting writing prompts on here- just a thought).

Great work, Bulge_Lover! I really enjoyed that read! Any other Redditors willing to share?
